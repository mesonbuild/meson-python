name: Run Sage CI for Linux

## This GitHub Actions workflow provides:
##
##  - portability testing, by building and testing this project on many platforms
##    (Linux variants)
##
##  - continuous integration, by building and testing other software
##    that depends on this project.
##
## It runs on every push to the GitHub repository.
##
## The testing can be monitored in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository.
##
## After all jobs have finished (or are canceled) and a short delay,
## tar files of all logs are made available as "build artifacts".
##
## This GitHub Actions workflow uses the portability testing framework
## of SageMath (https://www.sagemath.org/).  For more information, see
## https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/portability_testing.html

## The workflow consists of two jobs:
##
##  - First, it builds a source distribution of the project
##    and generates a script "update-pkgs.sh".  It uploads them
##    as a build artifact named upstream.
##
##  - Second, it checks out a copy of the SageMath source tree.
##    It downloads the upstream artifact and replaces the project's
##    package in the SageMath distribution by the newly packaged one
##    from the upstream artifact, by running the script "update-pkgs.sh".
##    Then it builds a small portion of the Sage distribution.
##
## Many copies of the second step are run in parallel for each of the tested
## systems/configurations.
